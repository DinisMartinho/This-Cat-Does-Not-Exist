# This Cat Does Not Exist

This model is designed to generate realistic images of cats using the WGAN generator architecture. It is a very simple model, with a straightforward design that makes it easy to understand and implement. The model is trained on a dataset of 5000 images of cats, which allows it to learn the features and characteristics that define the appearance of a cat. Once trained, the model is able to generate 64x64 images of cats that are highly realistic and visually compelling. Overall, this model represents a powerful tool for generating images of cats and could be used for a variety of applications.
